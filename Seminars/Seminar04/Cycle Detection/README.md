[Cycle Detection](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/detect-whether-a-linked-list-contains-a-cycle/problem)

A linked list is said to contain a cycle if any node is visited more than once while traversing the list. Given a pointer to the head of a linked list, determine if it contains a cycle. If it does, return . Otherwise, return .

Example

head refers to the list of nodes 1->2->3->null

The numbers shown are the node numbers, not their data values. There is no cycle in this list so return false.

head refers to the list of nodes 1->2->3->1

There is a cycle where node 3 points back to node 1, so return true.
